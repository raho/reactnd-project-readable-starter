# Readable Project

This is my project for React & Redux course (a second part of React Nanodegree Program in Udacity). It's a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based web application that allows user to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and for the frontend application.


## Installation

To start the project locally:

* clone the github repository
* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* Install and start the frontend app
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`


## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
